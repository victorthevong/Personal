    "<p>In this project we implemented de Casteljau's algorithm for evaluating Bezier curves which in turn allowed us to evaluate Bezier Surfaces. We then implemented local shading vs flat shading via area weighted normals for vertices of half edges in the mesh. Next came edge flipping and splitting which lead to upsampling via loop subdivision. Lastly, we implemented phong shading which allowed us to replicate lightning on surfaces.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p> Casteljau's algorithm is used to evaluate Bezier curves (parametric curves used in computer graphics which are used for smooth surfaces and easy to scale). We start by evaluating n-1 pairs of control points from an original n control points belonging to the Bezier curve (1,2  3,4  5,6  7,8 ..  n-1,n). Continuing this process and subdividing each line segment of the polygon with ratio t:(t-1) until we are down to 1 single point which is the evaluation of the original Bezier curve at value parameter t. The evaluation of the pairs of control points is done via linear interpolation of pairs of points through the formulation: lerp(pi, pi+1, T) = (1âˆ’T)*pi + T*pi+1. As we continually subdivide out one point via lerp of pairs eventually we come down to exactly one point.</p>\n",

    "<p>Briefly explain what you did.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The previous examples of the teapot were done via flat shading (giving the entire triangle the exact same shade). The point of average normals for vertices of half-edges is to establish local shading (area shading averaged normals for vertices) for triangles to produce a smoother and more consistent shade overall. Esentially the process for this was for each vertex it has set of triangles in which it belonged to (i.e. all faces converged at that vertex for some point). In order to get an overall local estimation we took an average weighted normal of the set of faces via traversing all its halfedges (and thus bounding vertices) and taking the cross product of each pair vectors created by the bounding vertices (i.e. two vectors of the face). After doing this, we returned the re-normalized unit vector of the area-weighted normal sum.</p>\n",

From there I started coding and started by establishing all features listed on my drawings. I had a few mishaps which caused black triangles, but overall I was able to perform all pointer changes in constant time. I did not snap screenshots of the black triangles as I did not read the spec until after the fact of fixing my bugs (sorry - learned my lesson). This process required no new attributes to be added, simply changed. An overview, I simply rotated all internal elements within each triangle after the edge flip, keeping the outside half edges the same and just re-establishing new halfedge twins after the rotation(s), etc.</p>\n",

The reason splitting immensely before upsampling helps to keep shape better is because with more triangles around via the splits and some flips creates more \"dense\" objects which when upsampled will be able to maintain shape and not have edges move into another faces terrority as with the cube. Symmetrical upsampling for the cube can be achieved if we make each face symmetrical before upsampling. In point if we make each face of a cube be a nxn grid then after upsampling it will retain its shape</p>\n",
