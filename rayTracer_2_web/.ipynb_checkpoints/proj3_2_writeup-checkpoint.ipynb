    "<p>In this project we built on top of project 3-1 by implementing BSDF's for Mirror, Glass and Microfacet materials. We then incorporated environment lighting as well as depth of field controlling both aperature and focal distance of our camera (allowing specific area focus on images).</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>As we can see, when depth = 0 the balls are completely dark as no light ever hits the mirror (left) and glass (right) balls. When depth = 1, we get a little light showcasing the mirror ball, and some reflection on the glass ball, but still heavily noisy. At depth = 2, we can start to see the refracting within the glass ball having multiple bounces, but the reflection of the glass ball in the mirror ball is still dark. At depth = 3, we see the glass ball in the mirror ball is now accurate and a light spot underneath the glass ball has emerged. In depth = 4, we now see an added circular light spot to the right of the glass ball on the wall. At depth = 5 and 100, the images are roughly similar to depth = 4 signaling we get roughly full effects for this image at depth = 4. </p>\n",
